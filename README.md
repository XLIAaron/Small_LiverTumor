# SLTD Dataset: Tailored for Small Liver Tumor Detection

This dataset is designed specifically for the task of **detecting small liver tumors** from contrast-enhanced CT scans. It is released alongside our paper:

ðŸ“„ [**"PCA-YOLO: A Small Liver Tumor Detection Model with Patch-Contrastive Attention"** (MIDL 2025)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=iEBZjNZ63T)

---

- Focused on **small tumor instances**
- This dataset includes carefully selected CT slices that contain small liver tumors, each annotated with bounding box labels provided by experienced radiologists.
